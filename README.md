# HTWG Corporate Identity LaTeX Template => adapted for the EI faculty

Warning, the cover and title PDF have badly replaced icons, which could lead to ugly printing or pdf exports. It would be better to get the official EI covers from a professor.

This was just done for a case study homework, and is not an official layout of the HTWG Konstanz. Use with care!
